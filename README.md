# Lab 01: Empirical Benchmarking and The Maximum Subarray Problem

## Overview

In this lab, you will explore how to benchmark algorithms. Given an algorithm that solves the Maximum Subarray Problem (described below), you will design a baseline algorithm, implement both the baseline and optimized algorithms in Python, and benchmark both to compare the difference in their running time.

For this lab, you will be working in your project teams. If you do not have a team, see the teaching staff to get assigned to one. Here is the [project list](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1pTKetb_EuZRGcA39BaDLchRSRRrMXAxWEI9UJK41JOU/edit?usp=sharing).

Note: fork this repository to your own GitHub account before starting the lab!

**The Problem:** The Maximum Subarray Problem.
Given a list of integers (containing both positive and negative numbers), find the contiguous sublist with the largest sum.
For example: 

```
Input: [-2, 1, -3, 4, -1, 2, 1, -5, 4]
Output: 6
Explanation: The contiguous sublist [4, -1, 2, 1] has the largest sum = 6.
```

## Part 1: Baseline Algorithm Design

Before looking at optimized solutions, your first task is to design a baseline or "naive" solution.

**Design:** Devise an algorithm that finds the maximum subarray by evaluating all possible contiguous subarrays. Write down the steps clearly in pseudocode before moving on to the implementation. 

*Hint:* see the pseudocode for Kadane's Algorithm in Part 2 for guidance on how to structure your approach.

```
Algorithm: Baseline Soultion
Input: A list A of n integers
Output: The maximum contiguous subarray sum


1. max_so_far = negative infinity
2. for i in range len(A):
      current_max = 0
   
      for j in range (i,len(A)):
         current_max = current_max + A(j)

         if current max > max_so_far:
            max_so_far = current_max
   return max_so_far
```


## Part 2: The Optimized Algorithm (Kadane's Algorithm)

Computer scientist Jay Kadane developed an elegant, dynamic programming approach to this problem that runs in $O(N)$ time.

Review the pseudocode below. You will implement this alongside your baseline algorithm.

```
Algorithm: KadaneMaxSubarray(A)
Input: A list A of n integers
Output: The maximum contiguous subarray sum

1. max_so_far = negative infinity
2. current_max = 0
3. For i from 0 to n-1:
4.     current_max = current_max + A[i]
5.     If current_max > max_so_far:
6.         max_so_far = current_max
7.     If current_max < 0:
8.         current_max = 0
9. Return max_so_far

```

## Part 3: Python Implementation & Data Generation

You will now implement both algorithms in Python and set up an experimental framework to test them.

1. **Implementation:** Write two Python functions, `baseline_max_sublist(arr)` and `kadane_max_sublist(arr)`.

```python
def baseline_max_sublist(A):
    max_so_far = float("-inf")

    for i in range(len(A)):
        current_max = 0

        for j in range(i, len(A)):
            current_max += arr[j]

            if current_max > max_so_far:
                max_so_far = current_max

    return max_so_far
```

```python

def kadane_max_subarray(A):
    max_so_far = float('-inf')
    current_max = 0

    for i in A:
        current_max += i

        if current_max > max_so_far:
            max_so_far = current_max

        if current_max < 0:
            current_max = 0

    return max_so_far

```

2. **Data Generation:** Write a helper function using `numpy.random.randint` to generate random integer lists of a given length. Ensure the lists contain both positive and negative numbers (e.g., range from -100 to 100).


3. **Benchmarking Setup:**

   * Use `time.perf_counter()` to measure execution time.

   * Test your algorithms on lists of the following lengths: $N \in \{100, 500, 1000, 2500, 5000, 10000\}$.

   * **Important:** System background processes can cause noisy data. For each array size $N$, run the algorithms 5 to 10 times on freshly generated lists and record the *average* execution time.

## Part 4: Visualization

A crucial part of empirical benchmarking is communicating your results clearly. Use `matplotlib` and/or `seaborn` to visualize your data.

1. **The Plot:** Create a line plot with Array Size ($n$) on the x-axis and Execution Time (seconds) on the y-axis.

2. **Requirements:** Plot the execution times for both algorithms on the same axes. Include a clear legend, title, and axis labels. Try to make the plot look nice and readable!

3. **Logarithmic Scale (Optional but Recommended):** You will likely notice that the baseline algorithm's curve grows so fast that Kadane's algorithm looks like a flat line at $y=0$. Try plotting the y-axis on a logarithmic scale (`plt.yscale('log')`) to better observe the scaling behavior of both algorithms simultaneously.

## Part 5: Teaching Staff Check-in

Discuss your work with a member of the teaching staff to get feedback on your implementation and analysis. In particular, discuss the following:
- Be able to clearly describe the problem
- How your baseline algorithm works
- How Kadane's algorithm works
- Your plot showing the performance comparison between the baseline and Kadane's algorithm

 If everything looks good, then proceed to Part 6 and complete the exercise.

## Part 6: Exercise

Answer the following questions in a file called `reflection.md`:

1. At what array size did your baseline algorithm become noticeably sluggish to execute?

2. Based on your empirical data and the shape of your graph, estimate how long (in seconds, minutes, or hours) your baseline algorithm would take to process an array of $1,000,000$ elements. Show your reasoning.

3. Based on your empirical data and the shape of your graph, estimate how long (in seconds, minutes, or hours) your Kadane's algorithm would take to process an array of $1,000,000$ elements. Show your reasoning.
